# 2DGameTest Repository

This repository is for learning / practicing Cocos2D, Python.
I will make notes of important features / things I'll need to remember as I learn them, so I can refer to them when I start development

The main application, I will store in the environment 'envCocos'. All other test files will be kept in the 'origin/master' branch
